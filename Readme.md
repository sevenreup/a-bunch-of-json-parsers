## A bunch of parsers
This is a collection of implementations of a json-parser in different languages. 
The parser should be able to parse a json-string and return a data-structure that can be used in the language. 
The parser should be able to handle json-strings that are not formatted correctly and should return an error in that case.

## Notes
- The speed is not important
- Will probably use a recursive descent parser
